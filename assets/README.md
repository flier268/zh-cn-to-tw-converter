# Assets

Place your application icons here:

- **icon.png** - 512x512 PNG for Linux AppImage
- **icon.ico** - Windows ICO file (multiple resolutions: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256)

You can create icons using online tools like:
- https://www.icoconverter.com/ (PNG to ICO)
- https://favicon.io/ (Icon generator)

For now, the build will work without icons, but it's recommended to add them for a professional appearance.
